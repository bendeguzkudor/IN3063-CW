Neural Network Implementation for Fashion MNIST Classification
This project implements a flexible neural network from scratch using NumPy for classifying Fashion MNIST data. 

The implementation includes parameterizable layer sizes, multiple activation functions, dropout regularization, and various optimization methods.

Setup:

1. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv environment
2. Activate the environment: env\Scripts\Activate
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

Run python main.py
